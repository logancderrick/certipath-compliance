    "content": "The Commission of the European Union (EU) has stepped up its efforts to ensure that Member States implement the provisions of the EU Directive on hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment.\n\nAccording to a press release, the Commission has issued infringement decisions to 27 individual Member States for failure to notify the Commission of their transposition efforts related to 11 different EU directives. The notices cover directives addressing the reporting of air pollutant emission projections, the exchange of information between law enforcement authorities in Member States, ferry safety, and others.\n\nOf greatest significance to our readers is the Commission’s infringement notice issued to Cyprus for its failure to communicate its actions to date to implement the provisions of the EU’s Directive on the restriction of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (EU 22014/1416, more widely known as the RoHS Directive).\n\nCypress has two months from the date of the Commission’s infringement notice to provide the Commission with an update on their efforts and to complete the transposition of the RoHS provision into national law.\n\nThe EU Commission press release on its efforts to enforce the transposition of EU RoHS Directive and other directives into the laws of Member States is available at https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/bg/inf_25_273.",

    "content": "Bi-partisan legislation that would mandate access to AM radio technologies in all new vehicles sold in the U.S. has passed another milestone.\n\nThe U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation voted to approve S.315, otherwise known as the AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act. The legislation mandates that U.S. consumers continue to have access to AM radio technology in new vehicles sold in the country.\n\nIn recent years, there has been much discussion about whether AM legacy technology should continue to be installed in new vehicles. However, broadcasts on the AM band can provide a critical communications lifeline in natural disasters when other radio technologies go offline.\n\nA companion bill to S.315, H.R. 979, was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives shortly after the Senate Committee’s action. The companion legislation, H.R. 979, will now be forwarded to the House Commerce Committee for review and discussion.\n\nThe text of the AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act as approved by the Senate Committee is available on the Congress.gov website at https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/315.",

According to an IEEE press release, the standard addresses methods and strategies for securing “electronic health records, electronic medical records, and in-hospital and wearable devices that communicate with each other and with other healthcare systems.”\n\nThe new standard represents a joint effort between the IEEE 2933 Working Group and Underwriters Laboratories. The IEEE says that more than 300 people from 32 countries were involved in the standard’s development effort, including representatives from industry, regulatory agencies, and university research institutes.\n\nThe IEEE’s press release on IEEE/UL 2933 is available at https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-standard-biomedical-devices-data.",

    "content": "In a bipartisan vote, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has proposed a multi-million dollar fine against a Chicago-based company for a robocall scheme that impersonated agents of the agency.\n\nIn a Notice of Apparent Liability (NAL) for Forfeiture issued in early February, Commission members unanimously approved a proposal to levy a nearly $4.5 million fine against Telnyx LLC. According to the Notice, the company made automated, pre-recorded phone calls in early February 2024 to over a dozen staff of the FCC as well as some staff family members.\n\nThe call messages claimed to originate from the FCC itself and instructed recipients to “press one” to speak with a representative of the FCC’s “Fraud Prevention Team.” Call recipients who did so were then told to pay the FCC $100 in Google gift cards for their “crimes against the state.”\n\nThe FCC has no fraud prevention team and did not initiate these calls.\n\nTelnyx has 30 days from the date the NAL was issued to either pay the fine in full or file a written response justifying a reduction or cancellation of the proposed penalty.\n\nThe text of the FCC’s Notice in connection with Telnyx is available at https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-409354A1.pdf.",

    "content": "Satellites deployed by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have detected electromagnetic waves in space that sound eerily like the chirping of a flock of birds.\n\nAccording to a recent paper posted to the website of Nature.com, a study conducted by NASA using its magnetospheric multiscale (MMS) satellites has detected rising-tone chorus waves about 1,000,000 km from Earth. Measurements by the MMS satellites identified discrete, rising-tone elements in the terrestrial neutral sheet, with frequencies frequently changing at a rate of about 100 Hz per second.\n\nThese wave-particle interactions and non-linear transfers within the chorus waves produce sounds surprisingly similar to the chirping noise made by birds during the early morning hours, NASA’s paper reports.\n\nThe paper on NASA’s findings on chorus waves in space that sound like birds chirping is available at https://nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08402-z.",
