The IEEE has partnered with a major testing and standards development organization to create a new standard to address the securing of biomedical devices and health-related data.

The name of the new standard says it all: IEEE/UL 2933, Standard for Clinical Internet of Things (IoT) Data and Device Interoperability with TIPPSS (Trust, Identity, Privacy, Protection, Safety, and Security. According to an IEEE press release, the standard addresses methods and strategies for securing “electronic health records, electronic medical records, and in-hospital and wearable devices that communicate with each other and with other healthcare systems.”

The new standard represents a joint effort between the IEEE 2933 Working Group and Underwriters Laboratories. The IEEE says that more than 300 people from 32 countries were involved in the standard’s development effort, including representatives from industry, regulatory agencies, and university research institutes.

The IEEE’s press release on IEEE/UL 2933 is available at https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-standard-biomedical-devices-data.
