The Education Committee (EdCom) of the IEEE EMC Society would like to invite students currently enrolled in a college or university at either the Ph.D., graduate, or undergraduate level to submit a method for locating an RF source in the presence of unknown reflections. Building upon last year’s theme, the student design contest will again feature a fox hunt in the exhibit hall, but with some additional EMI challenges. Three low-power radio transmitters operating on different frequencies near 146 MHz will be hidden in the exhibit hall of the EMC+SIPI 2025 Symposium.  The task for the team is to locate each transmitter as quickly as possible. The top three selected teams will be required to attend the EMC+SIPI 2025 Symposium in Raleigh, NC to compete and demonstrate their design on August 19, 2025.
